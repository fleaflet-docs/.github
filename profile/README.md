# flutter_map

This was a temporary organisation, set up during the rewrite of the documentation website, so that the documentation authors could communicate and work with each other without interrupting the main project.

Since the website has now been completed, this organisation and it's repository(s) have been archived.

See the official flutter_map repository at: <https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map>. You can find the authors that worked in this organisation on [this page on the website](https://docs.fleaflet.dev/credits).

Many thanks to all those that helped!
